# Conflicts

## Introduction

Sometimes different word forms are homographs. Several cases exist:

- same accent, same hyphenation → no difficulty for patterns
- same accent, different hyphenation → choice for patterns
- different accents, different hyphens → different patterns for the accented version, choice for the non-accented pattern

## List of words

For each pair of conflicting words, the choice made for the patterns is indicated.

- `supereris`: su-pé-re-ris (supero) vs su-pér-e-ris (supersum) → accented patterns are different and correct both, the non-accented word give `su-per-e-ris`

- `superes`: sú-pe-res (supero) vs sú-per-es (supersum) → `su-per-es` and `sú-per-es`

- `superi`: sú-pe-ri (superus) vs sú-per-i (supereo) → `su-pe-ri` and `sú-pe-ri`

- `superis`: su-pé-ris (superus) vs su-pér-is (supereo) → `su-pe-ris` and `sú-pe-ris`
